#Copying the Gemfile from the actual repo we can then run bundle install to update our dependencies.
#Another thing it's solving here is that Docker wouldn't know that our dependencies have changed when we add new gems
#to the Gemfile. When docker copies the Gemfile and hashes it, it looks at the checksum of the hash and notices that it
#has changed. Then it runs all commands from then on. For that reason we're adding this part in the end. Just so if our
#Gemfile changed docker will not have to run all the previous commands.
