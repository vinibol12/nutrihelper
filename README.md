Simple RoR Web App for Nutritionists to keep track of their clients' evaluations. 

### Allows the professional to:

* Log in as Admin
* Add/Remove clients 
* Create appointments
* Log appointment notes
* Create anthropometric evaluations
* Keep track of evaluations in the customer history

### Allows customer to: 

* Sign up
* Login

This is an MVP. So far I have only developed the Admin interface. 
I'm willing to add new features such as:

* Ability for customer to fill a pre-consultation form so the professional can better prep for consultation.
* Customer to see their appointment history and evaluations
* Charts for progress visualization
* Booking requests


### Requires 

* Ruby 2.3.3
* Rails 5.0.1
* Devise 
* Material css 0.100.2
* PostgreSQL

(Other dependencies listed in the Gemfile)
